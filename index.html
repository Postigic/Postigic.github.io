                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am fueled by an unwavering passion for all things related
                    to Science, Technology, Mathematics, and Engineering (STEM).
                    My passion-filled journey started at Bukit View Secondary
                    School (BVSS), where my Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) was
                    Information and Communication (Infocomm). Throughout these 4
                    years, I wholeheartedly dedicated myself to this path,
                    honing my skills to a level where I can be reasonably proud
                    to share it with others.
                </p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    During the first two years of Secondary School, my grades
                    improved significantly compared to my time in Primary
                    School. I wrapped up my junior years on a positive note with
                    straight A's in my end-of-year exams. For Secondary 3 I took
                    Pure Double Sciences (Physics/Chemistry), Double Maths,
                    Computing and Geo/SS.
                </p>
                <h3>Co-Cirricular Activities (CCA)</h3>
                <p>
                    At Bukit View Secondary School (BVSS), I was always eager to
                    attend and actively participated in lessons. As such, in
                    Secondary 3 I was given the role of Vice President due to my
                    tried and true passion for the CCA. These four years were
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My ultimate goal is to become an Engineer or a Programmer.
                    The idea of being a programmer has intrigued me since
                    Primary 5, and more recently, I've found an interest in
                    working as an engineer, particularly in electronics and
                    electrical or mechanical fields. My desire to bring pride to
                    my parents, who have been my main supporters on this
                    journey, propels me towards achieving this goal. Their
                    encouragement has kept me going; without it, I might have
                    given up long ago.

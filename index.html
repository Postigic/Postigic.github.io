                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a self-proclaimed software developer [ sketchy, I know.
                    (ᵕ—ᴗ—) ] who has a intense passion for everything STEM. This
                    passionate journey begun when I entered my Secondary School,
                    Bukit View Secondary School (BVSS) which I entered through a
                    Direct School Admission (DSA) into the Information and
                    Communication (Infocomm) Co-Cirricular Activity (CCA). To
                    me, those four years were more than academics; they were a
                    playground for my passion and curiosity. I also like J-Rock!
                    If you couldn't tell... （´∇｀''）
                </p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's set the record straight from the start: I wasn't
                    exactly what you'd call a diligent student in Primary
                    School. But once I stepped into the world of Secondary
                    School, it was a wake-up call, a jolt to my soul that made
                    me realise the consequences of continuing down the path I
                    was on. And so I made a decision to turn things around and
                    push myself to be better. It definitely wasn't easy, but
                    boy, was it worth it. I flourished in my junior years,
                    achieving straight A's in my end-of-year exam. This effort
                    extended into my senior years, where I took up Pure Physics
                    and Chemistry and Additional Mathematics.

                    haha. ]
                </p>
                <h3>Co-Cirricular Activities (CCA)</h3>
                <p>
                    Besides academics, I was always eager and actively
                    participated in every CCA session. My dedication did not
                    remain unnoticed, and as such in Secondary 3 I was given the
                    role of Vice President after an interview due to my
                    unwavering passion for the CCA. These four years were
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    For my goals, I've set my sights on the stars: which is to
                    become an engineer or programmer. The idea of being a
                    programmer has fascinated me ever since I was in Primary 5,
                    and the world of engineering, particularly in electronics
                    and electrical or mechanical fields, has been calling my
                    name as of late. But beyond that, a desire to bring pride to
                    my parents who have been my North Star on this journey fuels
                    me towards achieving this goal. Their encouragement has kept
                    me going; without it, I might have given up long ago.
